# Constraint Graph Floorplanning

A C++ implementation of floorplanning using Horizontal Constraint Graph (HCG) and Vertical Constraint Graph (VCG). Computes coordinates, slack,critical edges, and optimized area based on HW3 specifications.

### Features
- Build HCG & VCG from input
- Lower-left placement (Formula 1)
- Layout width/height computation (Formula 2)
- Upper-right placement (Formula 3)
- Slack computation
- Critical edge detection
- Horizontal-edge shifting for area optimization
